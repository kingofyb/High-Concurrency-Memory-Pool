# High-Concurrency-Memory-Pool
The current project is to implement a high-concurrency memory pool. Its prototype is tcmalloc, an open source project of Google. tcmalloc stands for Thread-Caching Malloc, which is thread-cached malloc. It implements efficient multi-threaded memory management and is used to replace the system's memory allocation related functions (malloc, free).
